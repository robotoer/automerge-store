# Automerge-db

- key-value store-style API. Store automerge docs so CRDTs are built-in.
- indexing support??? Use postgres backend to allow dev to do whatever.
- simple-setup??? Use log-file backend for no-infra setup.
- security settings. Model after firestore rules? Deploy code along with store-style api? Pre-canned language?
  - Base this off of user claims in a token.
- WYSIWYG editor for React (collaborative). Should presumably be written in React itself.
